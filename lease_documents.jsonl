The consent of Owner to an assignment or subletting shall not in\nany way release You from obtaining the consent in writing of Owner to any further assignment\nor subletting. It is expressly understood and agreed that the character of the occupancy of the\nApartment, as above restricted, is a special consideration and inducement for the granting of\nthis Lease, and in the event of violation by You of the restriction against subletting or\nassignment, this Lease may, at the option of the Owner or the agent or assigns of Owner, be\nterminated in the manner provided in Article 17 hereof.\nB.

That initiative became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986,\nbetter known by its original name of Proposition 65.\nProposition 65 requires the State to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or\nother reproductive harm. This list, which must be updated at least once a year, has grown to include\napproximately 750 chemicals since it was first published in 1987.\nProposition 65 requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts of chemicals in the\nproducts they purchase, in their homes or workplaces, or that are released into the environment. By\nproviding this information, Proposition 65 enables Californians to make informed decisions about\nprotecting themselves from exposure to these chemicals. Proposition 65 also prohibits California\nbusinesses from knowingly discharging significant amounts of listed chemicals into sources of drinking\nwater.\nThe Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) administers the Proposition 65 program.\nOEHHA, which is part of the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA), also evaluates all\ncurrently available scientific information on substances considered for placement on the Proposition 65\nlist.\nWhat types of chemicals are on the Proposition 65 list?\nThe list contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that are known to cause\ncancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. These chemicals include additives or ingredients in\npesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes, or solvents. Listed chemicals may also be\nused in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor\nvehicle exhaust.\nHow is a chemical added to the list?\nThere are three principal ways for a chemical to be added to the Proposition 65 list. A chemical can be\nlisted if either of two independent committees of scientists and health professionals finds that the\nchemical has been clearly shown to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. These two\ncommittees\u2014the Carcinogen Identification Committee (CIC) and the Developmental and Reproductive\nToxicant (DART) Identification Committee\u2014are part of OEHHA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. The committee **FOR SAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY- YOU MUST CONSULT WITH AN\nATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AGREEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**\nmembers are appointed by the Governor and are designated as the \u201cState\u2019s Qualified Experts\u201d for\nevaluating chemicals under Proposition 65. When determining whether a chemical should be placed on\nthe list, the committees base their decisions on the most current scientific information available. OEHHA\nstaff scientists compile all relevant scientific evidence on various chemicals for the committees to review.\nThe committees also consider comments from the public before making their decisions.\nA second way for a chemical to be listed is if an organization designated as an \"authoritative body\" by the\nCIC or DART Identification Committee has identified it as causing cancer or birth defects or other\nreproductive harm. The following organizations have been designated as authoritative bodies: the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA), National Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health, National Toxicology Program, and International Agency for Research on\nCancer.\nA third way for a chemical to be listed is if an agency of the state or federal government requires that it\nbe labeled or identified as causing cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Most chemicals\nlisted in this manner are prescription drugs that are required by the U.S. FDA to contain warnings relating\nto cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.\nIn addition to these three listing procedures, Proposition 65 also requires the listing of chemicals meeting\ncertain scientific criteria and identified in the California Labor Code as causing cancer or birth defects or\nother reproductive harm. This method was used to establish the initial chemical list following voter\napproval of Proposition 65 in 1986.\nWhat requirements does Proposition 65 place on companies doing business in California?\nBusinesses are required to provide a \"clear and reasonable\" warning before knowingly and intentionally\nexposing anyone to a listed chemical. This warning can be given by a variety of means, such as by\nlabeling a consumer product, posting signs at the workplace, distributing notices at a rental housing\ncomplex, or publishing notices in a newspaper. Once a chemical is listed, businesses have 12 months to\ncomply with warning requirements.\nProposition 65 also prohibits companies that do business within California from knowingly discharging\nlisted chemicals into sources of drinking water. Once a chemical is listed, businesses have 20 months to\ncomply with the discharge prohibition.\nBusinesses with less than 10 employees and government agencies are exempt from Proposition 65\u2019s\nwarning requirements and prohibition on discharges into drinking water sources. Businesses are also\nexempt from the warning requirement and discharge prohibition if the exposures they cause are so low\nas to create no significant risk of cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Health risks are\nexplained in more detail below.\nWhat does a warning mean?\nIf a warning is placed on a product label or posted or distributed at the workplace, a business, or in\nrental housing, the business issuing the warning is aware or believes that one or more listed chemicals is\npresent. By law, a warning must be given for listed chemicals unless exposure is low enough to pose no\nsignificant risk of cancer or is significantly below levels observed to cause birth defects or other\nreproductive harm.\nFor a chemical that causes cancer, the \"no significant risk level\u201d is defined as the level of exposure that\nwould result in not more than one excess case of cancer in 100,000 individuals exposed to the chemical\nover a 70-year lifetime. In other words, a person exposed to the chemical at the \u201cno significant risk level\u201d **FOR SAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY- YOU MUST CONSULT WITH AN\nATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AGREEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**\nfor 70 years would not have more than a \u201cone in 100,000\u201d chance of developing cancer as a result of\nthat exposure.\nFor chemicals that are listed as causing birth defects or reproductive harm, the \u201cno observable effect\nlevel\u201d is determined by identifying the level of exposure that has been shown to not pose any harm to\nhumans or laboratory animals. Proposition 65 then requires this \u201cno observable effect level\u201d to be divided\nby 1,000 in order to provide an ample margin of safety. Businesses subject to Proposition 65 are required\nto provide a warning if they cause exposures to chemicals listed as causing birth defects or reproductive\nharm that exceed 1/1000th of the \u201cno observable effect level.\u201d\nTo further assist businesses, OEHHA develops numerical guidance levels, known as \u201csafe harbor\nnumbers\u201d (described below) for determining whether a warning is necessary or whether discharges of a\nchemical into drinking water sources are prohibited. However, a business may choose to provide a\nwarning simply based on its knowledge, or assumption, about the presence of a listed chemical without\nattempting to evaluate the levels of exposure. Because businesses do not file reports with OEHHA\nregarding what warnings they have issued and why, OEHHA is not able to provide further information\nabout any particular warning. The business issuing the warning should be contacted for specific\ninformation, such as what chemicals are present, and at what levels, as well as how exposure to them\nmay occur.\nWhat are safe harbor numbers?\nAs stated above, to guide businesses in determining whether a warning is necessary or whether\ndischarges of a chemical into drinking water sources are prohibited, OEHHA has developed safe harbor\nnumbers. A business has \u201csafe harbor\u201d from Proposition 65 warning requirements or discharge\nprohibitions if exposure to a chemical occurs at or below these levels. These safe harbor numbers consist\nof no significant risk levels for chemicals listed as causing cancer and maximum allowable dose levels for\nchemicals listed as causing birth defects or other reproductive harm. OEHHA has established safe harbor\nnumbers for nearly 250 chemicals to date and continues to develop safe harbor numbers for listed\nchemicals.\nWho enforces Proposition 65?\nThe California Attorney General\u2019s Office enforces Proposition 65. Any district attorney or city attorney (for\ncities whose population exceeds 750,000) may also enforce Proposition 65. In addition, any individual\nacting in the public interest may enforce Proposition 65 by filing a lawsuit against a business alleged to\nbe in violation of this law.\nLawsuits have been filed by: the Attorney General\u2019s Office, district attorneys, consumer advocacy groups,\nand private citizens and law firms. Penalties for violating Proposition 65 by failing to provide notices can\nbe as high as $2,500 per violation per day.\nHow is Proposition 65 meeting its goal of reducing exposure to\nhazardous chemicals in California?\nSince it was passed in 1986, Proposition 65 has provided Californians with information they can use to\nreduce their exposures to listed chemicals that may not have been adequately controlled under other\nState or federal laws. This law has also increased public awareness about the adverse effects of\nexposures to listed chemicals. For example, Proposition 65 has resulted in greater awareness of the **FOR SAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY- YOU MUST CONSULT WITH AN\nATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AGREEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**\ndangers of alcoholic beverage consumption during pregnancy. Alcohol consumption warnings are perhaps\nthe most visible health warnings issued as a result of Proposition 65.\nProposition 65\u2019s warning requirement has provided an incentive for manufacturers to remove listed\nchemicals from their products. For example, trichloroethylene, which causes cancer, is no longer used in\nmost correction fluids; reformulated paint strippers do not contain the carcinogen methylene chloride;\nand toluene, which causes birth defects or other reproductive harm, has been removed from many nail\ncare products. In addition, a Proposition 65 enforcement action prompted manufacturers to decrease the\nlead content in ceramic tableware and wineries to eliminate the use of lead-containing foil caps on wine\nbottles.\nProposition 65 has also succeeded in spurring significant reductions in California of air emissions of listed\nchemicals, such as ethylene oxide, hexavalent chromium, and chloroform.\nAlthough Proposition 65 has benefited Californians, it has come at a cost for companies doing business in\nthe state. They have incurred expenses to test products, develop alternatives to listed chemicals, reduce\ndischarges, provide warnings, and otherwise comply with this law. Recognizing that compliance with\nProposition 65 comes at a price, OEHHA is working to make the law\u2019s regulatory requirements as clear as\npossible and ensure that chemicals are listed in accordance with rigorous science in an open public\nprocess.\nWhere can I get more information on Proposition 65?\nFor general information on the Proposition 65 list of chemicals, you may contact OEHHA\u2019s Proposition 65\nprogram at (916) 445-6900, or visit: http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.html.\nFor enforcement information, contact the California Attorney General\u2019s Office at (510) 622-2160, or visit\nhttp://caag.state.ca.us/prop65/index.htm.\nThe undersigned Tenant(s) acknowledge(s) having read and understood the foregoing, and receipt of a\nduplicate original.\n__________________________________________________________\nTenant Date\n__________________________________________________________\nTenant Date **FOR SAMPLE PURPOSE ONLY- YOU MUST CONSULT WITH AN\nATTORNEY FOR LEGAL AGREEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**\nMOLD NOTIFICATION ADDENDUM\nThe lessor endeavors to preserve and promote quality of life for tenants.

Ownerdoesnotpromise,warrant,orguaranteethesafetyorsecurityofresidentsortheir\npersonal property against the criminal actions of other residents or third parties. (For purposes of this security\npolicy, \"owner\" includes owner, owner's officers and employees, and owner's property management company,\nonsite managers, and other owner representatives, and \"resident\" refers to the Resident(s) and their families,\noccupants, guests and invitees of the Unit.) Owner is not acting as insurer of resident. Resident understands and\nagrees that owner is limited in its ability to protect resident from crime, accident and natural catastrophe and that\nresident is better able to evaluate individual risk and loss than owner and to obtain insurance to protect against\nsuchevents.Eachresidenthastheresponsibilitytoprotecthimselforherselfandtomaintaininsurancetoprotect\nhis or her belongings and person. Owner strongly recommends that residents contact an insurance agent to\narrangeappropriateinsurance.\nIt is a fact that no security system, patrol, or electronic security device can provide protection against crime at\nevery location at every moment of the day or night. Even elaborate security systems are subject to mechanical\nmalfunction, tampering, human error or personnel absenteeism, and can be defeated or avoided by clever\ncriminals.Therefore,residentsandoccupantsshouldnotrelyonsuchsystemsandshouldalwaysproceedonthe\nassumption that no security systems exist. Residents should make no other assumptions regarding security. The\nbest safety measures are those precautions that can be performed as a matter of common sense and habit.\nResidentunderstandsthatcrimesagainstpersonsareprevalent,especiallyinapartmentcommunities.\nIf security systems, security devices, or walk-through/drive-through services are utilized at this apartment\ncommunity, no representation is made that they will prevent injury, theft or vandalism. Companies or individuals\nwalking or driving the complex on behalf of owner are unarmed independent contractors and have no greater\nauthority under the law to restrain or arrest criminals or to prevent crime than the ordinary citizen. Resident\nunderstands and agrees that owner has no obligation or liability for the acts or omissions, whether negligent,\nintentional or otherwise of any agent or employee of any such independent contractor. Resident acknowledges\nthat Owner is under no duty to inspect, test or repair any security device unless and until Owner has received\nwritten notice from Resident, except when the Lease Term begins and in the case of a smoke detector, when a\nnewdetectorisinstalledbyOwner.Ownerdoesnotwarrantthatanysecuritysystems,securitydevices,services,\nor persons at this apartment community will discourage or prevent breaches of security, intrusions, thefts, or\nincidents of violent crime, and owner has assumed no responsibility or duty with respect to the security of\nResidentthroughtheretentionofanysuchindependentcontractorsortheprovisionofanysuchsecuritysystems,\nsecurity devices, or services. Owner reserves the right to reduce, modify or eliminate any such independent\ncontractors, security system, security devices, or services (other than those required by law) at any time, without\nnotice to residents; and such action shall not be a breach of any obligation or warranty on the part of owner.\n\"NeighborhoodCrimeWatch\"signs,ifany,donotimplysafetyorsecurity.\nIf controlled access gates or intrusion alarms are provided, residents will be furnished written operating\ninstructions; and it is residents' responsibility to read them and to bring any questions to the attention of owner.\nFurther, it is residents' responsibility to promptly notify owner in writing of any known problem, defect, malfunction\nor failure of door locks, window latches, lighting, controlled access gates, intrusion alarms, and other\nsecurity-related devices. Each resident is responsible for reporting to owner any crime that he or she is aware of\nand that occurs in resident's apartment or in common areas near resident's apartment. If resident's apartment is\nequipped with an intrusion alarm, resident is responsible for all fines and other charges resulting from or\nattributable to the alarm, including false alarm charges. Resident shall pay for and replace batteries for smoke\ndetectors, if any, and shall pay for monthly service on the electronic alarm systems, if any, unless otherwise\nprovided in the Lease. Resident shall not disable, disconnect, or remove batteries from smoke detectors. If\nResident installs additional security devices, Owner shall be given the keys, codes or operating device\nimmediately upon installation and any such devices installed by Resident must comply with all applicable federal\nstate,municipalorothergovernmentallaw,code,regulationororder.\nProtecting residents from crime is the sole responsibility of residents and law enforcement agencies. Residents\nare required to call the police or 911 first if a crime occurs or is suspected. Residents are required to promptly\nreport to owner in writing any locks, latches, lighting, overgrown shrubbery, fences, gates, intrusion alarm, and\nother security-related devices that they believe are in need of repair or improvement. Any notices or requests by\nResident for inspection, installation or repair of security devices or smoke detectors must be in writing. Resident\nrecognizesthatOwner'seffortsarevoluntaryandnotobligatoryandaredoneinanefforttoprotecthissafety.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND RELEASE BY RESIDENTS. Resident has read, understood, and agrees to the\nabove security policy. Resident has received no representations or warranties, either express or implied,\nregardingsecurityorsecuritysystemsbeforeorduringtheleaseterm.Ownerhasnotstatedorimpliedtoresident\nin any way that security of person or property will be provided, promised, or guaranteed. Owner has not\nrepresented that the apartment community has been or will be free from crime or that the apartment community\nhas had little or no history of crime. Resident further acknowledges that Owner is not obligated under any\ncircumstances to respond to any signal from an intrusion alarm system. Resident agrees to read the \"Guidelines\nfor Resident Safety\" attached to the lease and to abide by those guidelines to the fullest extent reasonably\npossible.\n13 RESIDENT HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD OWNER HARMLESS FROM LOSSES,\nCLAIMS, AND COSTS (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES) WITH RESPECT TO ANY\nPERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR DEATH ARISING OUT OF CRIMINAL ACTS OF OTHER\nRESIDENTS AND THIRD PARTIES, OR WHICH IS IN ANY WAY RELATED TO RESIDENT'S RELIANCE ON\nANY OF THE SAFETY DEVICES AND/OR ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MENTIONED ABOVE OR TO\nANY DEFECT, MALFUNCTION OR INADEQUACY THEREOF, FROM CLAIMS THAT INSUFFICIENT\nSECURITY WAS PROVIDED, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTALLATION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF\nANY SECURITY DEVICE INSTALLED OR CAUSED TO BE INSTALLED BY RESIDENT, EVEN IF SUCH\nOCCURRENCE(S) WERE CAUSED BY THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTORY OR PARTIAL NEGLIGENCE OF\nOWNER.

All of us have lived with mold spores all our lives. Without molds we would all be struggling with large\namounts of dead organic matter. Mold breaks down organic matter in the environment and uses the end product for its\nfood. Mold spores (like plant pollen) spread through the air and are commonly transported by shoes, clothing and other\nmaterials.Whenexcessmoistureispresentinsideadwelling,moldcangrow.Thereisconflictingscientificevidenceasto\nwhat constitutes sufficient accumulation of mold which could lead to adverse health effects. Nonetheless, appropriate\nprecautions need to be taken. Preventing mold begins with you. The Resident is hereby notified that the Premises are\nsubject to the infestation of mold or mildew if not properly maintained.

Every apartment should be equipped with at least one smoke detector. Check them periodically to make sure\nthey work. Most smoke detectors can be tested by pressing the test button. Replace the batteries in the spring\nand fall when you move your clocks forward or back an hour, and whenever a smoke detector chirps to signal\nthat its battery is low. The smoke detector should be replaced on a regular basis in accordance with the\nmanufacturer'srecommendation,butatleastonceeverytenyears.\n2. Carelessly handled or discarded cigarettes are the leading cause of fire deaths. Never smoke in bed or when\nyou are drowsy, and be especially careful when smoking on a sofa. Be sure that you completely extinguish\nevery cigarette in an ashtray that is deep and won't tip over. Never leave a lit or smoldering cigarette on\nfurniture.\n3.

In such buildings, fires are\nmore likely to be contained in the apartment or space in which they start and less likely to spread inside the\nbuilding walls to other apartments and floors. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BUILDING IS IMMUNE\nTO FIRE. While the structural; components of the building may not catch fire, all of the contents of the building\n(including furniture, carpeting, wood floors, decorations and personal belongings) may catch on fire and generate\nflame, heat and large amounts of smoke, which can travel throughout the building, especially if apartment or\nstairwelldoorsareleftopen.\nA \"combustible\" or \"non-fireproof\" building has structural components (such as wood) that will burn if exposed\nto fire and can contribute to the spread of the fire. In such buildings, the fire can spread inside the building walls\nto other apartments and floors, in addition to the flame, heat and smoke that can be generated by the burning of\nthecontentsofthebuilding.\nBe sure to check Part I (Building Information Section) of this fire safety plan to see what type of building\nyouarein.\nMeansofEgress\nAll residential buildings have at least one means of egress (way of exiting the building), and most have at least\ntwo.Thereareseveraldifferenttypesofegress:\nInterior Stairs: All buildings have stairs leading to the street level. These stairs may be enclosed or unenclosed.\nUnenclosed stairwells (stairs that are not separated from the hallways by walls and doors) do not prevent the\nspread of flame, heat and smoke. Since flame, heat and smoke generally rise, unenclosed stairwells may not\nensuresafeegressintheeventofafireonalowerfloor.Enclosedstairsaremorelikelytopermitsafeegressfrom\nthe building, if the doors are kept closed. It is important to get familiar with the means of egress available in your\nbuilding.\nExterior Stairs: Some buildings provide access to the apartments by means of stairs and corridors that are\noutdoors. The fact that they are outdoors and do not trap heat and smoke enhances their safety in the event of a\nfire,providedthattheyarenotobstructed.\nFire Tower Stairs: These are generally enclosed stairwells in a \"tower\" separated from the building by air shafts\nopentotheoutside.Theopenairshaftsallowheatandsmoketoescapefromthebuilding.\nFire Escapes: Many older buildings are equipped with a fire escape on the outside of the building, which is\naccessed through a window or balcony. Fire escapes are considered a \"secondary\" or alternative means of egress,\nand are to be used if the primary means of egress (stairwells) cannot be safely used to exit the building because\ntheyareobstructedbyflame,heatorsmoke.\nExits: Most buildings have more than one exit. In addition to the main entrance to the building, there may be\nseparatesideexits,rearexits,basementexits,roofexitsandexitstothestreetfromstairwells.Someoftheseexits\nmay have alarms. Not all of these exits may lead to the street.

Interior fire alarm systems generally consist of a\npanel located in a lobby or basement, with manual pull stations located near the main entrance and by each\nstairwell door. Interior fire alarm systems are usually manually-activated (must be pulled by hand) and do not\nautomatically transmit a signal to the Fire Department, so a telephone call must still be made to 911 or the Fire\nDepartmentdispatcher.DonotassumethattheFireDepartmenthasbeennotifiedbecauseyouhearafirealarmor\nsmokedetectorsoundinginthebuilding.\nBe sure to review Part I (Building Information Section) of this fire safety plan to learn whether your\nbuilding is equipped with an interior fire alarm system and whether the alarm Is transmitted to the Fire\nDepartment,andfamiliarizeyourselfwiththelocationofthemanualpullstationsandhowtoactivatethem\nintheeventofafire.\nPublicAddressSystems\nAlthough generally not required, some residential buildings are equipped with public address systems that enable\nvoice communications from a central location, usually in the building lobby.
